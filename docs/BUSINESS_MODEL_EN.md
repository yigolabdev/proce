## Unit Economics

### Key Metrics Targets

| Metric | Year 1 | Year 3 | Year 5 | Industry Avg |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|--------------|
| **CAC** | $1,200 | $800 | $600 | $400-600 |
| **LTV** | $4,800 | $10,000 | $18,000 | $1,500-2,500 |
| **LTV/CAC** | 4.0x | 12.5x | 30.0x | 3.0x |
| **Payback Period** | 6 months | 4 months | 3 months | 12 months |
| **Gross Margin** | 70% | 78% | 82% | 70-80% |
| **Net Revenue Retention** | 102% | 108% | 115% | 100-110% |

### Detailed Calculations

#### CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost)

**Year 1**:
```
Marketing spend: $250K
Sales spend: $200K
Total S&M: $450K
New customers: 400
CAC = $450K / 400 = $1,125 → ~$1,200
```

**Year 3**:
```
Marketing spend: $1.5M
Sales spend: $1.0M
Total S&M: $2.5M
New customers: 3,000
CAC = $2.5M / 3,000 = $833 → ~$800
```

#### LTV (Lifetime Value)

**Assumptions**:
- Avg ARPU: $22/user/month (after discounts)
- Avg team size: 30 users
- Avg customer lifespan: 24 months (Year 1), 36 months (Year 3)
- Gross Margin: 70% (Year 1), 78% (Year 3)

**Year 1 LTV**:
```
Monthly revenue/customer = $22 × 30 = $660
Customer lifespan = 24 months
Total revenue = $660 × 24 = $15,840
LTV = $15,840 × 0.70 = $11,088

Adjusted for churn:
Annual churn: 40% → Avg lifespan 18 months
LTV = $660 × 18 × 0.70 = $8,316 → ~$4,800 (conservative)
```

**Year 3 LTV**:
```
Monthly revenue/customer = $25 × 35 = $875 (growth + upgrades)
Customer lifespan = 36 months
Annual churn: 25%
LTV = $875 × 36 × 0.78 = $24,570 → ~$10,000 (conservative)
```

#### Gross Margin

```
Year 1:
Total revenue: $1.0M
COGS (hosting, AI, support): $300K
Gross profit: $700K
Gross margin: 70%

Year 3:
Total revenue: $12.0M
COGS: $2.6M
Gross profit: $9.4M
Gross margin: 78%
```

#### Net Revenue Retention (NRR)

```
NRR = (Starting MRR + Expansion - Churn - Contraction) / Starting MRR

Year 1:
Starting MRR: $100K
Expansion (upgrades, user adds): $5K
Churn: -$5K
Contraction: -$2K
Ending MRR: $98K
NRR = 98% → Target 102% (improved)

Year 3:
Starting MRR: $500K
Expansion: $60K (12%)
Churn: -$30K (6%)
Contraction: -$10K (2%)
Ending MRR: $520K
NRR = 104% → Target 108%
```

### Cohort Analysis

```
January 2025 Cohort (100 customers):

Month 0: 100 customers, MRR $75K
Month 3: 95 (5% churn), MRR $72K
Month 6: 88 (12% cumulative), MRR $70K (some upgrades)
Month 12: 75 (25% annual churn), MRR $65K
Month 24: 60 (40% 2-year churn), MRR $58K
Month 36: 50 (50% 3-year churn), MRR $52K

Avg lifespan: 24-30 months
